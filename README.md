# Vatara Model School (React)

This is my first large-scale project, and it's built in React. It's for a fictional school named **"Vatara Model School."**

## About the Setup

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and build. It's initialized with a minimal setup for React and includes:

- **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)** for quick updates
- ESLint for code linting
- Vite plugins like:
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react)
  - or optionally [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) for using SWC

## Notes

If you're planning to expand this project, consider using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules.
